# About Me
 * ## My Interests
   * **Video games** - I have a Playstation 5, and enjoy many different games, such as _The Last of Us, God of War, and Days Gone_.
   * **Movies** - any kind besides romance.  The _Equalizer_ films are great, and anything with Jason Statham. 
   * **Netflix Series** - mostly action genre.  I just recently watched _Squid Games 2_ and it was great.  Can't wait for Season 3!
   * **Dogs** - I have a 4 year-old mini Border Doodle named Bandit.
   * **Hanging out with friends**
 * ## Music Videos I Recommend
   * ### **[_REDNECKER_ - Hardy](https://youtu.be/Sn2RBKPMpU0)** - I think this video is very funny
